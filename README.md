This project is part of my studies base on the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/

I modified this project a little bit, because I am using this program to collect emails of colleagues from course, to finish HoneyComb task.

API used to collect emails in project: https://mailchimp.com/

Production on Heroku servers.
